# 🔐  Performance Analysis of Explainable Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for IoT Networks: A Systematic Review 

This project presents a systematic review of performance analysis of explainable deep learning-based intrusion detection systems for IoT networks. It analyzes the trade-offs among detection accuracy, computational overhead, and explanation quality. Following the PRISMA methodology, 129 peer-reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025 were systematically analyzed to address key research questions related to XAI technique trade-offs, deep learning ar-chitecture performance, post-deployment XAI evaluation practices, and deployment bottlenecks.

## 📘 Overview

- **Objective**: This review provides a structured foundation and actionable insights for the development of trustworthy, efficient, and deployable explainable IDS solutions in IoT ecosystems.
- **Findings**:
  - (RQ1) that while post-hoc methods like SHAP and LIME do not affect the underlying model's detection accuracy, they impose a severe and often excessive computational overhead, introducing significant latency and energy costs that hinder real-time deployment on IoT devices. 
  - (RQ2) reveals that while complex models like autoencoders and hybrids achieve superior detection rates, lightweight CNNs offer a more pragmatic balance for resource-constrained environments.
  - (RQ3) uncovered a major methodological shortcoming, which is an overwhelming reliance on subjective, qualitative plausibility checks, with an absence of human-centric or application-based validation, leaving the practical reliability of explanations unproven.
  - (RQ4) presents some bottlenecks such as the computational cost of post-hoc XAI, the lack of efficiency reporting, and the scarcity of realistic IoT-domain datasets, and proposed mitigations such as model-specific explanations, efficiency benchmarking standards, and collaborative dataset creation.
